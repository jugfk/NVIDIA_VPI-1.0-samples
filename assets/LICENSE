  Authorized holders of the Photo CD sampler disc may use, manipulate,
  store, transmit, reproduce and display the recorded images for any
  purpose associated with electronic imaging.  Unless otherwise agreed,
  a picture credit identifying the photographer must accompany each
  reproduction of an image, but no picture credits may be used for
  images altered or manipulated other than by cropping, enlarging,
  "dodging and burning" or changing overall color balance.
